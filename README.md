# Packaging notes

Some packaging notes. Please keep up to date.

## beta

The beta branch is used for pre-release and testing.

## Wayland

Wayland support is buggy in Qt. It's disabled.

## Network access

Network access is enabled for the "online" features.

## Filesystem access

It was set that way in the original submission. MuseScore 4 seems to
use the native file dialog though. Needs investigating.
